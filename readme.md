# Ask me anything!

## [Ask a question](../../issues/new) &nbsp; or &nbsp; [Read questions](../../issues?q=)

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Work. Life. Design. Code. Whatever.

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests for other projects should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Be civil and polite :)
